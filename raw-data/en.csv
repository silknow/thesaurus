It refers to the strong, soft, lustrous fibre or fibroin (continuous protein filament) produced or secreted by the larvae of certain bombycine moths, specially moth caterpillars, the Bombyx mori (known as the silkworm) which feed upn mulberry leaves when construction their cocoons. The silk is secreted as a viscous fluid from two glands in the lateral part of the body and it joins the secretion of sericin from two other glands that quickly hardens and cements the two filaments together.

523,Telar de alto lizo,,523,High-warp loom,,,"It refers to those early high-warp looms in which the warps were attached to a beam at the top, and groups of warp threads were weighted at the bottom. The weft was beaten up (i.e., pushed) toward the top as the weaving progressed. High-warp looms of this type are pictured on ancient Greek vases. In later high-warp looms the vertical frame has heavy uprights holding a horizontal roller at top and bottom, on which the warps are stretched. Each warp passes through a loop of cord (the lisses), and the loops encircling the warps that correspond to uneven numbers are fastened to one slender cylinder; those to the even-numbered warps are fastened to another cylinder. Both cylinders are above the weaver but within reach so that he can pull forward first with one, then with the other set of warps (i.e., form the shed) in order to pass his bobbin behind them. The bobbin (broche) is a short, pointed, slim cylinder of polished wood on which the weft yarn is wound.","Encyclopaedia Britannica, 8th ed., s.v. “Internet.” Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2009.

524,Telar de bajo lizo,,524,Low-warp loom,,,"In the low-warp loom, it has the rollers on the same level at table height so that the warps stretched between them are horizontal. To leave the weaver’s hands free, the warps are attached to two slats, or poles, each of which is connected with a treadle so that the weaver’s foot depresses the odd-numbered or even-numbered series of warps to form a passageway for the bobbin, called a shuttle on the low-warp loom. The cylinders in both instances serve to roll up the finished portion and unroll a further length of unwoven warps so that the section in process is always taut and in a convenient relation to the weaver. At both types of loom the weaver works from the back side, that is, he weaves the tapestry on the wrong side. He has, however, a hand mirror, which he puts through the unwoven warps holding it to reflect the right side of the portion in process. While the high-warp weaver can examine his finished work directly by walking around to the other side of his loom, the low-warp worker has to tilt up his frame.","Encyclopaedia Britannica, 8th ed., s.v. “Internet.” Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2009.

It describes the arts in Italy from the early 14th to the mid-16th centuries, but it is also more loosely applied to other European countries of that era. The art style was based on renewed study of the art of antiquity and of nature. In textile, the Italian designs predominate and became universal models. n the last third of the 16th century, fabrics destined for decoration and those destined for clothing are clearly differentiated. Large decorative rapports evolve for upholsteries, while new lighter fabrics appear with smaller motifs for new suits.","Clarke, Michael. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms (2nd ed).

682,Estilo barroco,,682,Baroque style,,,"The Baroque style took place in Europe between c.1600 and c.1750. It is broadly accepted today that ‘Baroque’ implies dynamism and movement, and a theatricality dependent on a mastery of space and geometry. All Baroque art is indebted to the technical achievements of the Renaissance. Essentially a Catholic art, the Baroque spread from Italy to Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, and later to southern Germany. The main fabrics of the beginning of the 18th century are the ""bizarre fabrics"", in vibrant colours strongly contrasted with floral motifs. These fabrics were followed by those who order their decorations in symmetrical compositions of vertical undulating evolution, with softer colours. Simultaneously, the fabrics coexist to rococo taste with its subtle palette of pastel colors. The discoveries of the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum make the colors of Pompeii's frescoes fashionable along with decorative elements of that moment.","Clarke, Michael.

In textile, this style was characterized by its elegance, sensuality and grace from a hedonistic artistocracy. Its themes are sentimental, where curved lines, light colors and asymmetry played a fundamental role in the composition. By 1740 and 1750 the rapport was structured based on wavy vertical lines forming branches, and from 1760 they were combined with ribbons that simulated lace. This style goes into decline around 1770.","Clarke, Michael. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms (2nd ed). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010. (online)",,,
684,Estilo medieval,,684,Medieval style,,,"A style during the period that covers approximately from the 5th to 15th centuries A.D. The variety of styles that developed during this period is generally characterized by an evolution of the Greco-Roman tradition to incorporate Christian themes. Specifically in the 15th century, the rich Italian city-states (Venice, Florence, Lucca) became the center of the textile trade throughout Europe, something similar happened to Lyon, although its boom began in the sixteenth century until the 19th century. On the other hand, there was an important production of silk in the Spanish Mediterranean area (València and Murcia) from the 15th century. For textiles, during this century, vegetable and floral forms predominated, such as palms, flowery pineapples and pomegranates, a trend that had begun in the 14th century. Velvet fabrics reached its technical perfection with increasingly complex decorations. In fabrics of international scope, the decorative form that characterizes the designs of the 15th century called the Gothic feature or clause, appeared, within which the iconographic programs are developed. In addition to the mentioned designs, some designs resemble the tracery of the gothic cathedral windows and the zoomorphic themes in the patterms are eliminated.","«Art & Architecture Thesaurus (Getty Research Institute)».

In the 15th century this compositional style persisted, combining meneaux decoration and vegetable decorations, lending itself to numerous variations, introducing trimmings, ribbons, stems, etc. In the 16th century, vegetable motifs and meneaux merged into a single motif, until the vegetable motif prevailed, enlarging its dimensions.","Migeon, Gaston.
