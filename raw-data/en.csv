The binding points are set over by one end on successive picks and form diagonal lines.Sequential threads skip or float over one or more interlacements in a diagonal alignment, forming a unit with no less than three warps and three wefts. Each end passes over two or more adjacent picks and under the next one or more, or under two or more adjacent picks and over the next one or more. The binding points are set over by one end on successive picks. The repeat of a twill is described according to the number of warps and wefts that float in sequence, such as 2/2, 3/1, or 1/2, etc. The bar used between the numbers indicates the direction of the twill diagonal, but the bar / is used also without any implication.

The silk is secreted as a viscous fluid from two glands in the lateral part of the body and it joins the secretion of sericin from two other glands that quickly hardens and cements the two filaments together. The silkworm winds this thread about itself to form a protective cocoon in which it passes the pupal stage. Silk has been an early trade item (from 2nd and 1st century B.C.) due to its many desirable qualities. It was a primary impetus for the establishment of lon-distance overland trade routes, known as the Silk Road. ","CIETA. Burnham, Dorothy. Warp and Weft. A Textile Terminology.

521,Cartonaje,,521,Tablet weaving,,,"When in Jacquard looms, it refers to a set of perforated tablets, linked as endless tape, that adapt to the Jacquard machine and determine the movement of the needles, deciding which will move and which will not, facilitating the raising or resting of the threads of warp to be taken or left, to weave a particular design. The tablet is done according to a previous sketch and put into letter. Over time the cartons have evolved in their physical form from cardboard, to continuous paper and finally to digital support.","Roberts A., Edward.

523,Telar de alto lizo,,523,High-warp loom,,,"It refers to those early high-warp looms in which the warps were attached to a beam at the top, and groups of warp threads were weighted at the bottom. The weft was beaten up (i.e., pushed) toward the top as the weaving progressed. High-warp looms of this type are pictured on ancient Greek vases. In later high-warp looms the vertical frame has heavy uprights holding a horizontal roller at top and bottom, on which the warps are stretched. Each warp passes through a loop of cord (the lisses), and the loops encircling the warps that correspond to uneven numbers are fastened to one slender cylinder; those to the even-numbered warps are fastened to another cylinder. Both cylinders are above the weaver but within reach so that he can pull forward first with one, then with the other set of warps (i.e., form the shed) in order to pass his bobbin behind them. The bobbin (broche) is a short, pointed, slim cylinder of polished wood on which the weft yarn is wound.","Encyclopaedia Britannica, 8th ed., s.v. “Internet.” Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2009. [https://www.britannica.com]",,,
524,Telar de bajo lizo,,524,Low-warp loom,,,"In the low-warp loom, it has the rollers on the same level at table height so that the warps stretched between them are horizontal. To leave the weaver’s hands free, the warps are attached to two slats, or poles, each of which is connected with a treadle so that the weaver’s foot depresses the odd-numbered or even-numbered series of warps to form a passageway for the bobbin, called a shuttle on the low-warp loom. The cylinders in both instances serve to roll up the finished portion and unroll a further length of unwoven warps so that the section in process is always taut and in a convenient relation to the weaver. At both types of loom the weaver works from the back side, that is, he weaves the tapestry on the wrong side. He has, however, a hand mirror, which he puts through the unwoven warps holding it to reflect the right side of the portion in process. While the high-warp weaver can examine his finished work directly by walking around to the other side of his loom, the low-warp worker has to tilt up his frame.","Encyclopaedia Britannica, 8th ed., s.v. “Internet.” Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2009. [https://www.britannica.com]",,,

663,Estilo a dentelle,,663,Dentelle Style,,,"It refers to those fabrics that are characterized by the use of a decoration that combined schematic vegetable motifs arranged symmetrically around a vertical axis, contained in stripes that imitate lace motifs. This typology appeared around 1690 recovering the framed vegetable motifs, characteristic of the late 16th century, but renewed through the inclusion of lace. They had great success in the 1690s and in the 1720s, but at this time the abstract vegetable motifs were progressively replaced by floral motifs, until around 1730 the flowers became the fundamental part of the composition. On a technical level, most of these fabrics consisted of a lamp with decorative weft lines and spines of metallic thread. In addition to the important presence of the metallic thread, a decoration is added with exotic flowers and fruits that developed in a wavy and vertical way. The great technical difficulty involved in its manufacture laid the groundwork for ""bizarre"" fabrics to be made.",,,,

The design was improved by his assistant Jean-Baptiste Falcon and by Jacques Vaucanson.[5] Although these improvements controlled the patterns woven, they still required an assistant to operate the mechanism. In 1804 Joseph Marie Jacquard demonstrated a mechanism to automate loom operation. A number of punched cards were linked into a chain of any length. Each card held the instructions for shedding (raising and lowering the warp) and selecting the shuttle for a single pass. It is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware.",

The cape replaced the wide-sleeved coat with a hat that would become the garment of the peasants of the fifteenth century.","Roberts A., Edward.
